# Professional Redux File Structuring Using State Slices

This code and documentation exemplify a structured approach for managing complex Redux applications with multiple initial states, reducers, and action creators.

## 1. Creating Slice Files for Structuring Redux File

- Organize features into folders (e.g., accounts & customers).
- Move related files to respective folders and update imports.
- Create Redux files for each feature (e.g., `accountSlice.js` and `customerSlice.js`) to define slices of the state, including reducers and action creators.

## 2. Importing Reducers from Slice Files to This Store

- Use `export default` for reducers (imported into the store).
- Use named exports for action creators (used within React components).
- Export the created store as the default export.
- Update import statements in the main application file (`index.js`) to include the store.
- Test dispatching actions in `index.js` to verify functionality.

## 3. Conclusion

- Reducers are divided into multiple slices, each containing initial state, reducer, and action creators.
- Slice files focus on functions and objects, excluding direct Redux usage.
- The store (`store.js`) is the central Redux hub where reducers are combined, the store is created, and it's exported for use in the application.

This structured approach simplifies the organization of Redux logic, making it more manageable and maintainable for larger applications.
