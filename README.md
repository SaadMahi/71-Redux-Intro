# Converting Account State Slice into Redux Toolkit

In this code, we convert the account state slice into a more modern and streamlined approach using Redux Toolkit. Here's a step-by-step overview of the transition:

1. **Introduction to Redux Toolkit**:

   - We are transitioning to Redux Toolkit, which simplifies the Redux setup.
   - Begin by installing Redux Toolkit using `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`.

2. **Replacing `createStore` with `configureStore`**:

   - In the modern approach, we switch from using `{ createStore }` from 'redux' to `{ configureStore }` from '@reduxjs/toolkit'.
   - `configureStore` streamlines the configuration process, including handling reducer combination, adding the thunk middleware, and setting up developer tools.
   - One of the key advantages is that we can now directly mutate the state within reducers, thanks to Redux Toolkit's use of Immer library.

3. **Simplifying the Store Setup**:

   - Unlike the classic Redux store setup, we no longer need to manually manage the reducer combination, middleware, or thunk.
   - We import `{ configureStore }`, call it, and specify the root reducer property, where we specify our reducers.

4. **Effortless Configuration**:

   - Setting up the store becomes straightforward with a call to `configureStore` and defining reducers.
   - Check the created slice to see the automatically generated action creators and reducers.

5. **Enhancing State Slices**:

   - Redux Toolkit allows for more intuitive state slice definition and management.
   - Create slices using the `createSlice` function and notice the improvement in defining reducers and action creators.

6. **Customizing Action Creators**:

   - While action creators are automatically generated, we can't easily make them accept multiple arguments.
   - A solution is to prepare the data before it reaches the reducer by defining a `prepare` method.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - You have the choice to stick with your existing Redux slices or embrace the modern approach offered by Redux Toolkit.
   - The transition to Redux Toolkit simplifies state management, reduces boilerplate code, and streamlines the overall configuration.

In summary, Redux Toolkit offers an enhanced way to work with Redux, making it more user-friendly and efficient. It retains compatibility with React-Redux and simplifies state slice management and configuration.
