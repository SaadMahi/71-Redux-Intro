# Reading Data from the Redux Store in a React Component

This code and documentation explain the process of reading data from the Redux Store within a React component using the `useSelector` hook provided by the `react-redux` package. Here's a concise description:

## Reading Data from Redux Store

To access data from the Redux store, you can use the `useSelector` hook, which is provided by the `react-redux` package.

## The `useSelector()` Hook

- The `useSelector` hook takes a callback function as its argument, which receives the entire Redux store.
- Within this callback, you can retrieve the specific data you need from the store, such as `useSelector(store => store.customer)`, which corresponds to the data structure defined in the `store.js` file.
- After obtaining the desired data, you can store it in a variable for use in your component.

By utilizing the `useSelector` hook, you can seamlessly access and use data from the Redux store within your React components, enhancing their interactivity and functionality.
