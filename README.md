# Dispatching Actions to the Redux Store from React Components

This code and documentation explain the process of dispatching actions to the Redux Store from React components using the `useDispatch` hook provided by the `react-redux` package. Here's a concise description:

## Dispatching Actions to Redux Store

In this setup, the goal is to dispatch an action that creates a new customer. To achieve this, the following steps are taken:

## Accessing the Dispatch Function

- To dispatch actions within a React component, you need to access the dispatch function, which is how actions are sent to the Redux store.
- The `useDispatch` hook is used to obtain the dispatch function, and it is stored in a variable like `const dispatch = useDispatch()`.

## Handling the Action Dispatch

- Within the component, you can use the dispatch function in response to an event, such as a button click.
- In this example, when the "Create new customer" button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called.
- The dispatch function is used to dispatch the `createCustomer` action creator with the relevant data, such as `fullName` and `nationalId` provided by the user.
- Before dispatching, data validation can be performed, ensuring that both `fullName` and `nationalId` fields are not empty.

By following these steps, you can easily dispatch actions from your React components, allowing for the interaction between your application's UI and the Redux store. The action creators defined in the `customerSlice.js` file facilitate the creation and dispatch of actions for specific functionalities.
