# Setting Up Redux Developer Tools

The provided code sets up a Redux store with the integration of Redux Developer Tools using the `redux-devtools-extension`. This description explains how Redux Developer Tools are incorporated into the code:

## 1. Setting Up Redux Developer Tools

Redux Developer Tools provide powerful debugging and state inspection capabilities. To use them, a few steps need to be followed.

## 2. Installing the Browser Extension

The first step is to install the Redux Dev Tools extension in your web browser. This extension enhances the debugging experience by allowing you to inspect and manipulate the state and actions.

## 3. Installing the Corresponding NPM Package

In addition to the browser extension, the code installs the corresponding npm package required for Redux Developer Tools. This package is installed using the following command:

```bash
npm i redux-devtools-extension
```

## 4. Importing composeWithDevTools

The code imports the composeWithDevTools function from the 'redux-devtools-extension' package. This function will be used to enhance the store setup with Redux Developer Tools.

## 5. Enhancing Middleware with Redux Developer Tools

To enable Redux Developer Tools, the code wraps the existing middleware, in this case, Redux Thunk, with the composeWithDevTools function. This enhances the middleware setup with debugging capabilities.

```js
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk))
);
```

## 6. Accessing Redux Developer Tools

Once the Redux store is configured with Redux Developer Tools, you can access the developer tools in your web browser. Typically, you'll find a new tab for Redux in the developer tools.

## 7. Exploring Developer Tools Features

The description highlights some key features of Redux Developer Tools, including:

- Viewing dispatched actions, their type, and payload.
- Inspecting the state after each action.
- Time-traveling between different state transitions to identify issues.
- Manually dispatching actions from the developer tools.

## 8. Manual Action Dispatch

Redux Developer Tools offer the capability to manually dispatch actions from the tools. This can be helpful for testing and debugging, allowing developers to interactively trigger actions without the need to wire up UI components.

In summary, the code enhances the Redux store setup with Redux Developer Tools, providing a valuable set of debugging and inspection features for monitoring state changes, debugging, and testing within the application. These tools are a powerful aid for Redux developers in diagnosing issues, understanding state changes, and manually triggering actions for testing purposes.
