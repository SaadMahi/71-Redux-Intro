# Migrating to Redux Toolkit - A Modern Approach

This code embraces Redux Toolkit, a modern way of working with Redux that simplifies and streamlines the setup process. Here's an overview of the transition:

1. **Introducing Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is fully compatible with traditional Redux but offers a more straightforward approach. To get started, install it using `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`.

2. **Replacing `createStore` with `configureStore`**: In this modern approach, we switch from using `{ createStore }` from 'redux' to `{ configureStore }` from '@reduxjs/toolkit'. `configureStore` streamlines the configuration process, automatically combining reducers, adding the thunk middleware, and setting up developer tools.

3. **Simplifying the Store Setup**: Unlike the classic Redux store setup, we no longer need to manually manage the reducer combination, middleware, or thunk. Instead, we import `{ configureStore }`, call it, and pass an object with the root reducer property, where we specify our reducers (in this case, `account` and `customer`).

4. **Effortless Configuration**: The new store setup is incredibly straightforward. With just a call to `configureStore` and the specification of reducers, our Redux store is ready.

5. **React-Redux Compatibility**: The part where we connect the React application with Redux remains unchanged. Redux Toolkit doesn't affect the React-Redux package and works seamlessly with it.

6. **Enhancing State Slices**: Redux Toolkit can further simplify the logic in state slices like `account` and `customer`. It offers a more intuitive way to define and manage state slices.

In summary, this code demonstrates a migration to Redux Toolkit, a more modern and user-friendly way of setting up Redux. It reduces boilerplate code and enhances the development experience while remaining fully compatible with React-Redux. This transition helps streamline the management of state slices and simplifies the overall Redux configuration.
