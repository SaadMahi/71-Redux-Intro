# Connecting the Redux Store with the React Application

This code and documentation explain the process of connecting the Redux store with a React application in Redux. Here's a concise description:

## Connecting Store with React Application

To link the Redux store with a React application, you need to use the `react-redux` package, which enables communication between React and Redux.

## Installation of `react-redux` Package

After installing the `react-redux` package (e.g., with `npm i react-redux`), you can connect the store to your React application.

## Providing the Store

1. Import the `Provider` component from 'react-redux'.
2. Wrap your entire application in the `Provider` component, passing the Redux store as a prop.
3. This establishes a connection between React and Redux, making it possible for every component in the application to access store data and dispatch actions.

By following these steps, you successfully integrate Redux with your React application, enabling components to read data from the store and dispatch actions to it.
